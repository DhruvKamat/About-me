        <h1 style=color:blueviolet <p>About Me</p> </h1>
        <p>It may seem odd, but I already have some semblance of a plan for the future. The area I want to find success in is Physics. In order to achieve this, I am going to study hard in a physics class and hopefully take some sort of data science course over the summers. With this I would hopefully get into some research project or internship. This may seem like a complicated plan, but I just had a lot of time to think about it. I just want to set up some goals becaus life can be hectic.  </p>

         <p>I think my main characteristic is that I am adaptable in tough situations. I make sure to retain calm and collected composure and to assist others through such a time as well. One weakness I have is my time management. I am trying to balance everything, but a lot of times I just forget and get caught up in the moment. While it hurts to admit, this struggle has given me a fair shair of problems, yet I am happy they occurred. While those problems were tough, they offered a learning experience that I couldn’t find anywhere else. </p>

        <p> Some places that I was able to express these skills were in my extracurriculars. Last year I participated in wrestling in Dublin High School. This was pretty challenging as at that time I wasn’t the strongest. I was weak compared to all the other wrestlers and had to work out a just to be able to compete. As well as this, I am in jazz band which allows me to find out a lot of information about working in a group. In band, especially jazz, you have to play off eachother and utilize eachothers others skills. This teaches me how to work as an established team which really helped me later in life. </p>

         <p> To conclude, I feel like though I have my mistakes, I can truely strive to achive something big. In the end that's my goal. To do something in life that people would remember is my true goal for life that I can't go without. </p>
